Calculation Steps
=================

Overview
--------

Once a project is saved, a job is launched in background. The purpose of this job is to compute the completeness and to notify users concerned by the project.
For each product we need to identify the user groups that has the rights to edit the product, once all the products have been checked we send a notification
to the concerned users (aka the contributors). The job also fill in a table that content user groups that has the right to edit at least one attribute of a
product that belong to the project.
The job `Job <https://docs.akeneo.com/master/reference/import_export/main-concepts.html#job>`_ contains steps. The main step of the job is the `CalculationStep`
which is used to execute an action between Project and Products. The main goal of this step is to extract data from the product to add information to the project.

Add a calculation step
----------------------

To add a new step you just need to create a new Step Class that implements a CalculationStepInterface

.. code-block:: php
    <?php

    namespace AcmeBundle\ProjectCalculation\CalculationStep;

    use Pim\Component\Catalog\Model\ProductInterface;
    use Akeneo\ActivityManager\Component\Model\ProjectInterface;

    class MyCustomStep implements CalculationStepInterface
    {
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function execute(ProductInterface $product, ProjectInterface $project)
        {
            // Implement the custom code here.
        }
    }

Then you need to define as a service with the tag `activity_manager.calculation_step`

.. code-block:: yaml

    activity_manager.calculation_step.user_group:
        class: 'AcmeBundle\ProjectCalculation\CalculationStep\MyCustomStep'
        public: false
        tags:
            - { name: activity_manager.calculation_step }
