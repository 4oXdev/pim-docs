Customizing validation
======================

Overriding existing validation
------------------------------

To override existing validation rules, you will have to copy the existing validation in your own bundle.

For example, to allow spaces in option codes, create the following file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/Acme/Bundle/CatalogBundle/Resources/config/validation/attribute.yml
   :language: yaml
   :prepend: # /src/Acme/Bundle/CatalogBundle/Resources/config/validation/attribute.yml
   :emphasize-lines: 170-182
   :linenos:

As you can see all the validation rules must be copied back in your file.


Adding new validation rules
---------------------------

To add new validation rules instead of replacing existing ones, simply create a new yml file in
the ``config/validation`` directory of your bundle. The name of the file **must** be different
from the already existing validation configuration files.

Product value validation
------------------------

Product value validation uses different mechanisms than those described above. For more details about
implementing your own rules, please read :doc:`../custom_entity/creating_an_attribute_type`.
