This chapter gives details on how to create and customize connectors to handle imports and exports in your Akeneo PIM project.

.. warning::

  The import part has been widely re-worked in 1.4.

  A new system has been introduced (new Connector Bundle + new Connector Component + Catalog API), the old system has been deprecated but is kept (parts of BaseConnector Bundle + parts of Transform Bundle), both systems are useable in the 1.4.
