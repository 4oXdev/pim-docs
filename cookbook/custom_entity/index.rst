How to Create a Custom Entity and Use it as an attribute
========================================================

Why Create a Custom Entity ?
----------------------------

In some cases, you may need to manage different entities than the one natively
provided by Akeneo and link them to the products.

.. note::
    if you do not need to use your custom entity as an attribute, follow
    only the first part of this cookbook's recipe.

.. note::
    The code inside this cookbook entry requires you to install the 
    `akeneo/custom-entity-bundle <https://packagist.org/packages/akeneo/custom-entity-bundle>`_ package.
    Full documentation for the bundle is available in its 
    `Github repository <https://github.com/akeneo/CustomEntityBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.rst>`_.
