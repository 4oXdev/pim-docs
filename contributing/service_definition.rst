Service Definition Convention
=============================

Service Definition
------------------

We defined the services in several files depending of the service purpose (form type, manager, etc.).

In each of these, a service is named with the following convention:

.. code-block:: yaml

  <pim_bundle>.<directory>.<entity>

For example, the product manager service is ``pim_catalog.manager.product``.

You can have several directories separated by dot like ``pim_catalog.form.type.product``.

Parameters Definition
---------------------

Parameters are defined in a specific file of the bundle, named ``parameters.yml``. All used classes must defined in this
file.

The convention used is the same as the one for services, with a ``.class`` suffix

The parameter for the product manager service class is ``pim_catalog.manager.product.class``
